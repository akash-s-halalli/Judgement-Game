# **App Name**: Distance Duel

## Core Features:

- Virtual Card Deck: Create a virtual card deck with standard playing cards. The deck should be based on standard card game formats such as a 52-card deck, including suits and ranks.
- Drag-and-Drop Gameplay: Implement a drag-and-drop interface for each player to manage their hand. Enable players to drag cards from the deck or their hand to the playing area. Include basic validation to ensure players can only play cards when it is their turn.
- Turn-Based Play: Implement turn-based mechanics. Each player can make moves only during their turn. Turn order should be clearly indicated, and players should be notified when it is their turn. Turns pass automatically after a certain action.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark green (#1E3A2B) to simulate a traditional card table.
- Secondary color: Gold (#D4AF37) to add a touch of sophistication.
- Accent: Burgundy (#800020) for interactive elements and highlights.
- A clean and intuitive layout with the card deck, player hands, and playing area clearly defined.
- Use standard card suit symbols (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades) in a simple and recognizable style.
- Smooth transitions and subtle animations for card movements and other actions.
